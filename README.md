# C-Work
I am creating this repo to store my C++ development work while learning. 


# days.cpp
This C++ program calculates the total number of days between two given dates: from a start date to the current date. It handles leap years and calculates the days for any given date range.
- Allows the user to input a current date and a start date.
- Accounts for leap years when calculating days.
- Calculates the total number of days between the two dates, considering the years in between.
- Outputs the total number of days up to the current date.


# index.cpp
This C++ program calculates and displays numbers along with their squares, cubes, and the sum of these values. The program allows the user to input a number, and it generates a table of the numbers from `0` to that number, showing the corresponding squares, cubes, and sums.
- Input a number up to 100.
- Outputs numbers, their squares, cubes, and sums.
- Displays the grand total of all sums.


# reverse.cpp
This C++ program ingeniously constructs a string from individual characters entered by the user and subsequently displays the assembled string in reverse order. It leverages fundamental array manipulation and loop control techniques to achieve this behaviour elegantly and straightforwardly.
- **Dynamic input length**: Empowers the user to define the desired length of the string at runtime.
- **Interactive character entry**: Requests each character one by one, allowing precise control over the string composition.
- **Reverse output**: Outputs the complete string in reverse order, demonstrating control over array indexing and decrementing loops.
- **Simple and intuitive design**: Written clearly for easy understanding and educational purposes.
  

# Prime.cpp
This C++ program classifies and displays numbers within a user-defined range as either prime or composite. The program allows the user to input a lower and upper limit, and it outputs all prime and composite numbers found in that range, along with their total counts.
- Enter custom lower and upper limits for the range.
- Outputs a list of all prime numbers and composite numbers separately.
- Displays the total count of prime and composite numbers.
