I am creating this repo to store my C++ development work while learning. 


# days.cpp
This C++ program calculates the total number of days between two given dates: from a start date to the current date. It handles leap years and calculates the days for any given date range.
- Allows the user to input a current date and a start date.
- Accounts for leap years when calculating days.
- Calculates the total number of days between the two dates, considering the years in between.
- Outputs the total number of days up to the current date.


# index.cpp
This C++ program calculates and displays numbers along with their squares, cubes, and the sum of these values. The program allows the user to input a number, and it generates a table of the numbers from `0` to that number, showing the corresponding squares, cubes, and sums.
- Input a number up to 100.
- Outputs numbers, their squares, cubes, and sums.
- Displays the grand total of all sums.
