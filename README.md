# C-Work
I am creating this repo to store my C++ development work while learning. 


# days.cpp
This C++ program calculates the total number of days between two given dates: from a start date to the current date. It handles leap years and calculates the days for any given date range.
- Allows the user to input a current date and a start date.
- Accounts for leap years when calculating days.
- Calculates the total number of days between the two dates, considering the years in between.
- Outputs the total number of days up to the current date.


# index.cpp
This C++ program calculates and displays numbers along with their squares, cubes, and the sum of these values. The program allows the user to input a number, and it generates a table of the numbers from `0` to that number, showing the corresponding squares, cubes, and sums.
- Input a number up to 100.
- Outputs numbers, their squares, cubes, and sums.
- Displays the grand total of all sums.


# reverse.cpp
This C++ program ingeniously constructs a string from individual characters entered by the user and subsequently displays the assembled string in reverse order. It leverages fundamental array manipulation and loop control techniques to achieve this behaviour elegantly and straightforwardly.
- **Dynamic input length**: Empowers the user to define the desired length of the string at runtime.
- **Interactive character entry**: Requests each character one by one, allowing precise control over the string composition.
- **Reverse output**: Outputs the complete string in reverse order, demonstrating control over array indexing and decrementing loops.
- **Simple and intuitive design**: Written clearly for easy understanding and educational purposes.
  

# Prime.cpp
This C++ program classifies and displays numbers within a user-defined range as either prime or composite. The program allows the user to input a lower and upper limit, and it outputs all prime and composite numbers found in that range, along with their total counts.
- Enter custom lower and upper limits for the range.
- Outputs a list of all prime numbers and composite numbers separately.
- Displays the total count of prime and composite numbers.


# Leniar.cpp
The program allows the user to input a number, generates its first 10 multiples, and then enables the user to search for a specific value among these multiples using a linear search algorithm.
- Input a number for which multiples will be generated.
- Stores the first 10 multiples of the given number in an array.
- Allows the user to search for a specific multiple in the list using linear search.
- Displays whether the searched multiple is found and shows its position in the array, or notifies if it is not found.


# Binary.cpp
This program allows the user to input a number, generates its first 10 multiples, and then enables the user to search for a specific value among these multiples using a binary search approach.
- Input a number for which multiples will be generated.
- Stores the first 10 multiples of the given number in an array.
- Uses a binary search logic to efficiently search for a specific multiple in the sorted list.
- Displays whether the searched multiple is found and shows its position in the array, or notifies if it is not found.


# Bubblea.cpp
This C++ program accepts five integers from the user, sorts them in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm, and then displays the sorted list. The program repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, continuing until the entire list is sorted.
- Accepts five integers as input from the user.
- Stores the integers in an array.
- Uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.
- Displays the sorted integers after sorting is complete.


# Bubbled.cpp
This C++ program accepts five integers from the user, sorts them in descending order using the bubble sort algorithm, and then displays the sorted list. The program repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order (for descending, if the left element is smaller), continuing until the entire list is sorted.
- Accepts five integers as input from the user.
- Stores the integers in an array.
- Uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort the array in descending order.
- Displays the sorted integers after sorting is complete.
